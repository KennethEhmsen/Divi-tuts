## UPDATE:
This solution was designed to work in older Divi Version, if you are using Divi 3.0 and above this solution will not work.

## How to use the files

1. first download the Divi child theme from ![this link](https://github.com/eduard-ungureanu/Divi-Child-Theme)
2. in `custom-modules` folder create a new file called `cbm.php`
3. copy the code PHP code from the `custom-modules > cbm.php` file above to your `custom-modules/cbm.php` on your server
4. in your `functions.php` from your server, put the PHP code from the functions.php above.


Once everything is done, when you edit the blog module, you will have a new option to enable/disable the AJAX pagination:
